# Crop-Management-System-IDLE
This is a python project developed by myself and Arpan. It has its extended version with complete GUI, which I developed using mostly tkinter modules. 


Crop Management System is a computer program, developed using python and MySQL. 
It mainly aims to help the farmers with the adequate information for growing crops and maximizing yields and profits. In this program the user will have to create an account of his own and sign-in through the same. This account can be used in future. After signing in the user can use the available functions.
Here, the data regarding the login credentials will be stored in MySQL which is used as a back phase. The rainfall data and the temperature data are stored in CSV files. The ordered seeds data will be stored in a binary file.
